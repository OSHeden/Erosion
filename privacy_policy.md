Many supported launchers
Icon Picker: see all icons included with sections and search
Icon request: free and premium requests. Premium requests are associated to the GOOGLE PLAY STORE accounts of OSHEDEN and the USERS.
Cloud based wallpapers that are stored on GITHUB website.
Changelog
Muzei live wallpaper
Localization: more than 10 languages are supported
Settings: clear cache, switch to the light/dark theme, restore purchases (associated to the GOOGLE PLAY STOREaccounts of OSHEDEN and the USERS), some information about OSHEDEN's work and where USERS can contact OSHEDEN.

No USER data is collected through the dashboard.

Candybar is open source. USERS can audit the code on GITHUB: https://github.com/zixpo/candybar-sample.

To know why the dashboards request some permissions, please read the built-in FAQ.

The CandyBar dashboard and the icon requests

An email is automatically generated thanks to the dashboard when USERS send icon requests to OSHEDEN. The following information are written in the body of their emails (basic information about their setups):

Manufacturer
Model
Product
Screen resolution
Android version
App version
CandyBar version
Transaction ID for premium requests only
App names of requested icons
Package names and activities of requested icons
GOOGLE PLAY STORE link of requested icons (even if the app is not available on GOOGLE PLAY)

Since OSHEDEN doesn't need these information to handle USERS' icon requests, USERS can remove the following informations from their emails: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
8 is used to check if the premium requests are official.
9, 10 and 11 are used to generated XLM files which are used by launchers to display the correct icons.

USERS' emails are sent to the email address of OSHEDEN's GOOGLE PLAY STORE account: osheden (at) gmail.com
Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google.

USERS can contact OSHEDEN if they want to get their emails deleted.
