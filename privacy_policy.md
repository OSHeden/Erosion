1. License checker (applications are downloaded from **GOOGLE PLAY**)
2. Many supported launchers
3. Icon Picker: see all icons included with sections and search
4. Icon request: free and premium requests. Premium requests are associated to the **GOOGLE PLAY STORE** accounts of **OSHEDEN** and the **USERS**.
5. Cloud based wallpapers that are stored on **GITHUB** website.
6. Changelog
7. Muzei live wallpaper
8. Localization: more than 10 languages are supported
9. Settings: clear cache, switch to the light/dark theme, restore purchases (associated to the **GOOGLE PLAY STORE** accounts of **OSHEDEN** and the **USERS**), some information about **OSHEDEN**'s work and where **USERS** can contact **OSHEDEN**.

No **USER** data is collected through the dashboard.

Candybar is open source. **USERS** can audit the code on **GITHUB**: https://github.com/danimahardhika/candybar-library

## The dashboard and the icon requests
An email is automatically generated thanks to the dashboard when **USERS** send icon requests to **OSHEDEN**.
The following information are written in the body of their emails (basic information about their setups):
1. Manufacturer
2. Model
3. Product
4. Screen resolution
5. Android version
6. App version
7. CandyBar version
8. Transaction ID for premium requests only
9. App names of requested icons
10. Package names and activities of requested icons
11. **GOOGLE PLAY STORE** link of requested icons (even if the app is not available on **GOOGLE PLAY**)

Since **OSHEDEN** doesn't need these information to handle **USERS**' icon requests, **USERS** can remove the following informations from their emails: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7**.  
**8** is used to check if the premium requests are official.  
**9, 10 and 11** are used to generated XLM files which are used by launchers to display the correct icons.

**USERS**' emails are sent to the email address of **OSHEDEN**'s **GOOGLE PLAY STORE** account: **osheden (at) gmail.com**  
Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google.

**USERS** can contact **OSHEDEN** if they want to get their emails deleted.
